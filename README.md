# LICENCE-PLATE-RECONGNITION-USING-ML-AND-PYTHON

License plate detection is identifying the part of the car that is predicted to be the number plate. Recognition is identifying the values that make up the license plate.License plate detection and recognition is the technology that uses computer vision to detect and recognize a license plate from an input image of a car.This technology applies in many areas. 

On roads, it is used to identify the cars that are breaking the traffic rules. In security, it is used to capture the license plates of the vehicles getting into and out of certain premises. In parking lots, it is used to capture the license plates of the cars being parked. The list of its applications goes on and on.Python gives us the ability to create our license plate detection and recognition program.

We achieve this by using three of its libraries; pytesseract(Pytesseract or Python-tesseract is an OCR tool for python that also serves as a wrapper for the Tesseract-OCR Engine. It can read and recognize text in images and is commonly used in python ocr image to text use cases.), (A series of convenience functions to make basic image processing functions such as translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization, displaying Matplotlib ...) (OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. 

OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human.)
